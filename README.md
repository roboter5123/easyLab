EasyLab is a collection of docker compose files that i use in my homelab.

You can also use these on yours in case you need any of these services! A lot of them are preconfgirued but some of them need aditional configuration which is marked by comments. 
Disclaimer; Some also need config files that are not in this repo yet! (Looking at you traefik) These will be included over time.
